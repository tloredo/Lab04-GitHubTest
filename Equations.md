Here is *Bayes's theorem*:
\[
p(H_i|D) = \frac{p(H_i) p(D|H_i)}{p(D)} \qquad ||~I.
\]
And, of course, the all-import LTP, where \(\{B_j\}\) is a *suite*:
\[
p(H_i) = \sum_j p(H_i,B_j) = \sum_j p(B_j) p(H_i|B_j) \qquad ||~I.
\]
And since it's so important, let's write the LTP with alignment:
\[
\begin{align}
p(H_i)
  &= \sum_j p(H_i,B_j)\\
  &= \sum_j p(B_j) p(H_i|B_j) \qquad ||~I.
\end{align}
\]
